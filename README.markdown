=====================

Simple plugin to apply an group of filters to raw content. The following
filters are included in this plugin

 * Markdown (markdown)

   Conversion from Markdown to HTML

 * InlineObject (inline_object)

   Parsing of inline objects. Requires [sfInlineObjectPlugin](http://github.com/weaverryan/sfInlineObjectPlugin)

   Conversion of carriage returns into actual html breaks &lt;br/&gt;

 * Url filter (url)

   Change all urls into actual links

Installation
------------

With git:

    git submodule add git://github.com/weaverryan/sfContentFilterPlugin.git plugins/sfContentFilterPlugin
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

With subversion

    svn propedit svn:externals plugins
    
    // In the editor, add the following entry and then save
    sfContentFilterPlugin https://svn.github.com/weaverryan/sfContentFilterPlugin.git
    
    svn up

In your `config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php` file, make sure you have
the plugin enabled.

    $this->enableAllPluginsExcept('sfPropelPlugin');

Usage
-----

This plugin comes packaged with several `filters` and more can be easily
added.

Using the plugin couldn't be easier. To filter a piece of content, simply
use the `filter_content()` helper. The first argument is the text to
filter and the second argument is the name of the filter, or the array
of filters to filter with:

    $text = 'Visit: www.sympalphp.org.';

    echo filter_content($content, 'url');

    Visit:<br/><a href="http://www.sympalphp.org" title="www.sympalphp.org">www.sympalphp.org</a>.

Optionally, you may also configure filter by a configured `input type`, which
is simply an ordered list of filters. For example, suppose the input type
`default` will apply the `line_break` and `url` filters:

    $text = 'Visit:
    http://www.sympalphp.org.';

    echo filter_content($content, 'default');

    Visit:<br/><a href="http://www.sympalphp.org" title="http://www.sympalphp.org">http://www.sympalphp.org</a>.

Notice how the `line_break` filter converted a line break into a &lt;br/&gt;
tag and the `url` filter converted a url into a full link.

Configuration
-------------

### Filters

Defining and customizing a filter is easy, and is done in an `app.yml` file:

    all:
      content_filter:
        filters:
          url:
            class:      sfContentFilterUrl
            cache:      true
            options:
              max_text_length: 72

All filter configuration is done beneath the `filters` key as seen above
and consists of the following options:

 * class

   This is the class that will perform the filtering. This class will
   extend `sfContentFilterAbstract`. Read below for more information on creating
   custom filters.

 * cache

   Whether or not to cache the filtering. This should usually be set to
   `true` and could otherwise hurt performance.

 * options

   An array of filter-specific options used to customize the filter


### Input Types

As mentioned before, input types are simply ordered collections of filters:

    all:
      content_filter:
        input_types:
          default:    [line_break, url, html_filter]

The above configuration defines an input type called `default`, which will
apply the `line_break`, `url`, and `html_filter` filters.

Creating Custom Filters
-----------------------

Creating custom filters couldn't be easier. First, define your filter in
`app.yml` by following the above examples. For example, suppose we want
to create a filter that automatically italicizes a list of given words.
We'll add this filter to our `default` input type:

    all:
      content_filter:
        filters:
          italicize:
            class:      sfContentFilterItalicize
            cache:      true
            options:
              words:    [symfony, sympal, drupal, sfContentFilterPlugin]
        
        input_types:
          default:    [line_break, url, italicize, html_filter]

The next step is to create the `sfContentFilterItalicize` class. This can
be placed anywhere, but I recommend that you create a `lib/content_filter`
directory and place it in there.

    // lib/filter/sfContentFilterItalicize.class.php
    class sfContentFilterItalicize extends sfContentFilterAbstract
    {
      public function _doFilter($content)
      {
        $words = $this->getOption('words');
        
        foreach ($words as $word)
        {
          $content = str_replace($word, '<i>'.$word.'</i>', $content);
        }
        
        return $content;
      }
    }

That's it! Now when you filter with the `default` input type, the words
`symfony`, `sympal`, `drupal` and `sfContentFilterPlugin` will all be italicized:

    echo filter_content('sfContentFilterPlugin is built in symfony and was inspired by sympal and drupal.', 'default');

    <i>sfContentFilterPlugin</i> is built in <i>symfony</i> and was inspired by <i>sympal</i> and <i>drupal</i>.

Caching
-------

Obviously, all of this string parsing can take a toll on your application's
performance. Fortunately, the result of the individual filters can be easily
cached.

To enable caching, define the cache driver in `app.yml`:

    all:
      content_filter:
        cache:
          enabled:  true
          class:    sfFileCache
          options:
            cache_dir:  <?php echo sfConfig::get('sf_app_cache_dir') ?>/content_filter

Now, each filter with the `cache` key set to true will be cached automatically.

The Fine Details
----------------

This plugin was written for and inspired by
[sympal CMF](http://www.sympalphp.org) and was developed by both Ryan Weaver
and Jon Wage.

Much of this plugin uses filters that were originally taken from Drupal,
because why reinvent what works?
